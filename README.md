# Dev Bootcamp tasks (Udemy Course) 

Repo to save my progress on the tasks, projects and general notes related to [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp) Udemy course I'm following.

## YelpCamp

YelpCamp is the "Big Project" of the course, where we will apply all knowledge that we gathered through the course. The project will grow bigger over time.
